# The Battle for Wesnoth - Visual and Audio Contributions

All visual and audio assets are licensed under either the GNU GPL v2 or later, or the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0. While existing contributions may be under the GNU GPL v2 or later, all future contributions will be under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license unless they are specifically noted to instead be under the GNU GPL v2 or later. In any case, regardless of whether a visual or audio contribution is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 or later or the CC BY-SA 4.0, the person contributing the asset always retains the full rights to their own work and can continue to use it in whatever way they wish.

Additionally, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all visual and audio assets that are posted to either the Music & Sound Development forum or to the Art Contributions forum are considered as potential contributions and are automatically placed under either the GNU GPL v2 or later (prior to July 30th, 2017), or the CC BY-SA 4.0 (as of July 30th, 2017).

For visual and audio assets that are licensed under the GNU GPL v2 or later, we interpret "preferred form of the work for making modifications" as the modifiable form that the author chooses to provide us for the source tree.

Visual and audio assets for which you do not own the rights cannot be accepted, nor can any derivative works, nor anything that falls under fair use.
