// runtime   vs compile time
//  Even though y has a const qualifier, the initialization value (the return value of getNumber())
// isnâ€™t known until runtime. Thus, y is a runtime constant, not a compile-time constant. 
//And because y is a runtime constant, evaluation of y must be done at runtime, so the expression x + y is also a runtime expression.

// x is a compile-time constant because its value is known at compile time. y, on the other hand,
// is a runtime constant because its value is determined during the execution of the program based on user input.
